## Discovery

Prediction markets are the future of trading anything, and with that comes many markets over 200,000 at some points. Recommendations, custom feeds, and sourcing data give users a way to trade what they know, what they want, and with speed.

## Data

Synthesis derives and surfaces the data you need to make informed trading decisions. From live events to news, to data that provides unseen correlations. We give you the information you need to trade with conviction.

## Social

Prediction markets at their core are social, and often traded on through groupthink. People have opinions, theses, and beliefs. Groups and communities will form around specific topics. Synthesis gives users a way to share information, get paid for sharing information, and capitalize on that information.
