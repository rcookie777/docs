## What Are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets allow you to trade on the outcome of future events. Each market asks a yes/no question about an event:

- "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by end of 2025?"
- "Will the next president be from a certain party?"
- "Will inflation exceed 3% this quarter?"

**How it works:**
1. Each market has two outcomes (typically "Yes" and "No")
2. Each outcome is represented as shares trading between $0.00 and $1.00
3. If the outcome occurs, shares settle at $1.00; if not, they settle at $0.00
4. The current price represents the market's probability of that outcome

**Example:** If "Yes" shares are trading at $0.65, the market believes there's a 65% chance the event will occur.
