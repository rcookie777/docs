## Copytrading

Automatically mirror trades from any Polymarket wallet address. Set up a copytrade to follow successful traders and execute their strategies in real-time.

### Modes

- **Copy** — Execute the same trades as your target wallet
- **Inverse** — Take the opposite side of your target's trades

### Position Sizing

Configure how much you want to trade relative to your target:

- **Percentage** — Trade a percentage of the target's position size
- **Fixed** — Trade a fixed USDC amount per trade
- **Range** — Set minimum and maximum amounts with percentage scaling

<Note>
Copytrading is available for Polymarket trades only.
