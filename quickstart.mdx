  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Your Position">
    After your trade executes:

## Common Beginner Mistakes

<Warning>
  Avoid these common pitfalls:
  
  **1. Not Reading Resolution Criteria**
  - Always check how the market resolves
  - Understand edge cases and specific terms
  
  **2. Using Wrong Order Type**
  - Market orders for speed, limit orders for price control
  - Don't use market orders on illiquid markets
  
  **3. Ignoring Liquidity**
  - Check orderbook depth before large trades
  - Low liquidity = wider spreads = worse fills
  
  **4. Overleveraging**
  - Start small while learning
  - Don't risk more than you can afford to lose
  - Prediction markets are not risk-free
</Warning>

## Practice Strategies

Before risking significant capital, try these:

1. **Paper Trading**
   - Watch markets without trading
   - Track hypothetical P&L
   - Learn market behavior

2. **Small Position Sizing**
   - Start with $10-50 trades
   - Focus on learning, not profits
   - Build confidence gradually

3. **One Market at a Time**
   - Don't spread yourself too thin
   - Master one category before expanding
   - Become an expert in a niche
