### Is this real money?
Yes. On Polymarket you trade with USDC on Polygon; on Kalshi you trade with USD in a regulated account.

### Can I trade on both venues?
Yes. Connect both and pick markets freely; the app routes orders to the correct venue.

### What are the fees?
- Polymarket: lower venue fees + small Polygon gas
- Kalshi: venue trading fees; see Kalshi schedule

### How do stop‑loss orders work?
You set a stop price; if the best bid reaches it, the system triggers a market sell for your specified shares.

### When do I receive settlement?
When the market resolves, winning shares settle to $1.00; losing settle to $0.00. Funds appear shortly after.

### How do referrals work?
Share your link with `?ref=CODE`. When referred users trade, you may earn rewards.

### Where do I see my P&L?
In Profile → Portfolio. You’ll see live P&L and a P&L chart over time.
