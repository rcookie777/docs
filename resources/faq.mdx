### When do I receive settlement?
When the market resolves, winning shares settle to $1.00; losing settle to $0.00. You will be notified in notifications or can view your portfolio for updates.

Share your link with `?ref=CODE`. When referred users trade, you may earn rewards.

### Where do I see my P&L?
In Profile → Portfolio. You’ll see live P&L and a P&L chart over time.
