## What you see

- **Best bid/ask**: top of book prices and sizes
- **Depth**: additional price levels (liquidity)
- **Recent trades**: tape of executed orders

## How to use it

- Tight spread and deep size → better fills
- Wide spread or shallow book → prefer limit orders
- Watch recent prints for momentum and reversals

<Tip>
  When placing a limit order, set price near the opposing side to get filled sooner, or inside the spread to improve the mid.
