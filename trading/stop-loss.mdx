## What is a stop‑loss?

A stop‑loss triggers a market sell when the price reaches your stop level, helping protect against larger losses if the market moves against you.

## How it works here

- You set a stop price (in cents)
- The system monitors live prices for your token
- When best bid ≤ your stop, it triggers a market sell of your specified shares

## Placing a stop‑loss

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Stop‑loss">
    In the trading panel, choose Stop as the order type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set stop price & size">
    Enter a stop price (¢) and the number of shares to protect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review the trigger level and confirm. You can cancel an active stop‑loss anytime before it triggers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Good practices

- Place stops below your entry (for long/Yes) to cap loss
- Avoid overly tight stops on choppy markets
- Review liquidity; stops execute as market orders when triggered

<Info>
  Once triggered, the sell executes immediately at the best available prices (Fill‑or‑Kill). Actual fill price may differ from the stop price in fast moves.
