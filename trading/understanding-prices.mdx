description: "From cents to probabilities and P&L"

## Price ↔ probability

- Share prices are quoted in cents (e.g., 65¢ = $0.65)
- Price ≈ implied probability of the outcome being true (65%)

## P&L math (Yes side)

- Max profit per share: \(1.00 - P\)
- Max loss per share: \(P\)
- If price rises from 65¢ → 75¢, unrealized gain ≈ 10¢/share (before fees)

## Bid, ask, and spread

- **Bid**: highest buy price
- **Ask**: lowest sell price
- **Spread**: ask − bid; smaller is better (more liquidity)

## Slippage and depth

- Market orders may fill across multiple price levels
- Larger orders move average fill price toward the book midpoint
- Use limit orders to cap price; check depth first

<Note>
  Charts show historical trades and mid‑prices. Portfolio P&L updates in real time based on live prices and your positions.
