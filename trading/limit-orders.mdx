## Why use a limit order

- **Price control**: only fills at your price or better
- **Queue for fills**: join the book and wait to be matched
- **Reduce slippage**: ideal in thin or volatile markets

## Placing a limit order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick outcome & price">
    Select Yes/No, choose Limit, and enter your limit price in cents (e.g., 62.5).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter size">
    Enter shares or USD amount. Minimum order is $1.00. Unfilled size is locked as In Orders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place & manage">
    Submit the order. You can cancel or edit by replacing it until it fills.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Partial fills

Your order can fill in parts as opposing orders arrive. Filled shares reduce your open size; remaining stays working in the book.

## Example

- You place a Buy Yes Limit at 60¢ for 200 shares
- If sellers hit 60¢, you’ll get filled up to your size
- If the market trades higher, your order remains open until matched or canceled

<Warning>
  Large orders on illiquid markets may take time to fill. Consider splitting across prices.
