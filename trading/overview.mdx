## What you can trade

Trade yes/no shares on questions about future events across two platforms: **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**. Share prices range from 0.00–1.00 (0–100¢) and reflect implied probability.

## How a trade works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick an outcome">
    Choose "Yes" or "No" for the market question. Price ≈ probability (e.g., 65¢ ≈ 65%).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select order type">
    Market for speed, Limit for control, Stop‑loss for protection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter size">
    Type an amount (USD) or number of shares. Minimum order is $1.00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & place">
    Check estimated shares, price, and fees, then confirm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding risk and P&L

- **Max profit (Yes at P)**: \(1.00 − P\) per share if the outcome resolves Yes (reverse for No)
- **Max loss (Yes at P)**: \(P\) per share if the outcome resolves No
- **P&L moves** with the market price; you can sell anytime before resolution

<Tip>
  Start small while learning. Wide spreads or low liquidity can cause worse fills.
  Use stop‑loss on volatile markets to cap downside.
</Tip>
