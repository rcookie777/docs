## When to use a market order

- **Speed over price**: you want in/out immediately
- **High liquidity**: tight spreads, deep book
- **Small size**: less risk of slippage

## How it works in the app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose outcome & order type">
    Select Yes/No and pick Market.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter size">
    Enter USD amount or shares (minimum $1.00). The app fetches a real quote before placing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review estimated average price and shares, then confirm the order.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

- Avoid market orders on wide spreads or thin books — use a limit order instead
- For larger size, consider splitting into multiple orders
- Watch the quote details (average price and slippage) before confirming

## Example

- Best ask is 65¢ and you buy $100 Market
- You receive ~153.8 shares; average price may be slightly higher if multiple levels fill

<Note>
  You can sell at any time. Final settlement occurs when the market resolves.
