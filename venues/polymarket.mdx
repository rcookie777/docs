## Account & funding

- Connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
- Use **USDC on Polygon**; keep a small amount of **MATIC** for gas (<$0.01/trade)
- Bridge USDC or withdraw directly to Polygon from an exchange

## Trading specifics

- Order types: Market, Limit, Stop‑loss
- Fees: lower venue fees; small Polygon gas cost
- Settlement: outcome resolves to $1.00 or $0.00; funds remain in your wallet

<Tip>
  Gas is minimal, but approvals may cost small one‑time fees per token.
