## Connecting to Polymarket

### Step 1: Prepare Your Wallet

You'll need:
- An Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- USDC on Polygon network
- Small amount of MATIC for gas (usually < $0.01 per trade)

### Step 2: Connect Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect Wallet">
    Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Wallet Provider">
    Select your preferred wallet from the list:
    - MetaMask (most popular)
    - WalletConnect (mobile wallets)
    - Coinbase Wallet
    - Other supported wallets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve Connection">
    - Approve the connection in your wallet popup
    - The platform only requests read access initially
    - No funds can be moved without explicit approval
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Switch to Polygon">
    If prompted, switch to Polygon network:
    - Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
    - RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com
    - Chain ID: 137
    - Currency Symbol: MATIC
    
    Most wallets will switch automatically when you make your first trade.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

To trade on Polymarket, you need USDC on Polygon:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bridge from Ethereum">
    Use the official Polygon bridge:
    1. Go to https://wallet.polygon.technology/
    2. Connect your wallet
    3. Bridge USDC from Ethereum → Polygon
    4. Wait ~10 minutes for confirmation
    
    <Info>Bridge fees are typically $5-20 depending on Ethereum gas</Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Buy Directly">
    Purchase USDC directly on Polygon:
    1. Use an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken
    2. Withdraw USDC to Polygon network
    3. Much cheaper than bridging (usually < $1)
    
    <Warning>Make sure to select Polygon network, not Ethereum!</Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Use a Ramp">
    Buy crypto with credit/debit card:
    1. Use ramp services integrated in wallets
    2. Buy MATIC first, then swap to USDC
    3. Higher fees (~3-5%) but fastest method
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
