## How referrals work

- Share your unique link with `?ref=YOURCODE`
- When someone signs up and trades, you earn referral rewards
- The app stores referral codes from links and applies them on signup/login

## Sharing your link

- Go to Profile → Rewards to copy your personal referral link
- Example: `https://yourdomain.com/?ref=ABCD123`

## For referred users

- If you signed up from a referral link, your code is applied automatically
- If you have a code but didn’t use a link, contact support to apply it

<Tip>
  Referral codes are captured when present in the URL and redeemed once you’re authenticated.
